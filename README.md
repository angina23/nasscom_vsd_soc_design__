**LEARNING  THROUGH LABWORK :** 

- Engaged in a two-week intensive workshop focused on the complete Physical Design process, from RTL to GDSII.
- Gained hands-on experience with Google-SkyWater 130nm technology using open-source tools like Yosys, Magic, and NGSpice.
- Developed and characterized standard cells, contributing to the generation of a GDSII file for System-on-Chip (SoC)
design.
- Did Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool and made timing ECO fixes to remove all violations(setup and hold time violations).
- Cloned a custom inverter standard cell design and  run the openlane flow to verifiy that it is accepted in PnR flow.
